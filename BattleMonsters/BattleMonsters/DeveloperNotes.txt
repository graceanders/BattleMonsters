Techincal Debt
many properties are still public when they do not need to be
Many values are set in multiple locations, some are loose threads that were set in an atempt to bug fix that did not solve the problem but were kept

Design Decisions:

Swapping, to make the battle easier to code I only allow the player to Swap at the begining anf not at the middle, due to limited time
ATKScore and DEFScore can sway the fight slightly but I did not get to types and those advantages
Some Battle specific values are still set/ajusted/handeled within GameManager, this is due to how connected it is to Game functionality, it was not as easy to detach as other elements such as Healig
Healing swaps through 1 at a time, instead of showing all the monsters that need healing, because it works better with my Keyboard controlled game
Same for Team Manager, I force then to manage the team in order for easier implimentation and for the sake of not having 20 Key inputs.
Raffle Manager I kept simple and allowed the player to pull one at a time because I did not feel it had to be more complicated.

I allowed the Character to CalculateCombindedATK, CalculateTeamHP, AddMonsterToTeam since both the Player and Enemy needed to be able to calculate

I added IInteractable to abstact the Button facits since they were elements of nrealy all of the managers but I did not get to adding it to all of them like Raffle Manager due to time
I added IAttack and IDefend in interfaces because I though that was the best way to add them in, but I feel the character would have simply had those interfaces, 
but in the fututre if I have NPC or a Character who can not fight the Interfaces will have a better reason
SO we shall say they are interfaces for scope, and furture add on

Enemy's Monsters will atempt to Run from there Enemy to escape dying, 
Enemy run and Player run are still the same but naraitivly are different
